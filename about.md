title: About N-Mac
---

I am a Boston-based data practitioner who is obsessed with the use of data to drive growth in early-stage companies. 

I started my career at an e-commerce/tech company where I held a variety of roles in merchandising, strategy, and operations. I picked up some solid SQL and Tableau skills along the way, but I was eager to learn more about the technical side of analytics. 

To do that, I did two things: firstly, I moved into a position as a BI consultant and became entrenched in cloud data warehousing, data modeling standards, data engineering pipelines, and data visualization best practices. Secondly, I spent 2 years attending evening classes to earn a Master's degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics.

After seeing both the business and technical sides of the proverbial coin, I realized that I would do my best work in a hybrid role, and that's how I ended up in my current role: directing a team of developers/analysts responsible for automating business performance reporting at an ag-tech startup in Charlestown, MA. 

**Other things I spend my time on:** playing around with data for side projects (unrelated to work, just for funzies), cooking, playing guitar (I specialize in converting hit 90's R&B jams and terrible 00's pop punk songs into acoustic snoozers), supporting the rampant local pub scene in Boston, and conducting an ongoing search for quality Tex-Mex in New England. If you have any suggestions on where to find some, let's taco bout 'em.
