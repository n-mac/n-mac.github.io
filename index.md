title: Data.Based

I am a Boston-based data practitioner who is obsessed with startups and early-stage companies. I started my career at an e-commerce/tech company where I held a variety of roles in merchandising, strategy, and operations. There, I discovered my passion and natural propensity for using analytics to solve business problems. Although I had picked up some solid SQL and Tableau skills along the way, I was curious to learn more about the technical side of analytics. I took a position as a BI consultant and became entrenched in cloud data warehousing, data modeling standards, data engineering pipelines, and data visualization best practices. Concurrently, I completed a Master's program in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics.

After seeing both the business and technical sides of the proverbial coin, I realized that I needed to be in a hybrid role that would allow me to continue honing my newfound tech skills with a focus on improving business performance and decision-making through data analysis. I currently lead a team responsible for automating standardized business performance reporting at an ag-tech startup in Charlestown, MA.  

Other things I spend my time on: playing around with data for side projects (unrelated to work, just for funzies), cooking, playing guitar (I specialize in converting hit 90's R&B and terrible 00's pop punk songs into acoustic snoozers), supporting local pubs, and an ongoing search for good Tex-Mex in Boston. If you have any suggestions, let's taco bout 'em.
